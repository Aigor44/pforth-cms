# PForth-CMS - Portable ANS-like Forth for VM/370

Last updated: 18.04.2023

This implementation derives from an earlier implementation for MVS-3.8j made in 2007 which is described [here](https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/forth-tagung07/vortraege/pforth.pdf).
Recently I rediscovered the sources and adapted the port to VM/370's GCCCMS compiler.
