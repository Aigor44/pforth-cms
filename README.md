# PForth-CMS - a Portable ANS-like Forth for CMS under VM/370 written in ANSI 'C'

Last updated: 18.04.2023

This implementation derives from an earlier implementation for MVS-3.8j made in 2007 which is described [here](https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/forth-tagung07/vortraege/pforth.pdf).

Recently I rediscovered the sources and adapted the port to VM/370's GCCCMS compiler.
